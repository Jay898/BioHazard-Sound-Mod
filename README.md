# BioHazard-Sound-Mod

This is an audio mod that utilizes different sound processing libs and drivers from various OEMs, combined all together, and the result is a very deep modification on how Android processes Audio. This mod was intentionally made for AOSP/CyanogenMod/CyanogenMod Based roms starting Android version 5.x and up, but should work on any stock roms not older than KK (and that compatibility layer depends on the ROM, some will work and some doesn't, you have been warned!)
